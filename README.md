snippets
========

It's just a store room where we keep the snippets.

###### What makes a good snippet:
* everything squeezed into a single file.
* insufficient, misleading documentation, if any.
* no helpful comments, if any.
* no error handling at all.
* almost everything hardcoded.
* not working out of the box.
